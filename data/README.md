# Data Folder README

This folder contains **raw and processed data** used for extracting and constructing the **Post-Traumatic Sepsis dataset**.

This repository **is initialized as empty** and will store **intermediate files** while the code runs.

ðŸš¨ **Note:** This repository **does not** include raw MIMIC-III data. Users must obtain access to MIMIC-III via **[PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)** and comply with its **data use agreement**.

## Folder Structure

### `raw/`
- **Contains**: Raw extracted data from MIMIC-III.
- **Usage**: Typically includes **all patients** before any cohort filtering.

### `processed/`
- **Contains**: Processed data specifically for the **trauma cohort**.
- **Usage**: May include **cleaned, aggregated, or transformed** data relevant to the **post-traumatic sepsis** task.


Description: 
    raw/        Contains raw extracted data from MIMIC-III. Normally, files saved in this foder will contans information from all patients. 
     processed/ Stores processed versions to cresate the dataset. Normally, files saved in this foder only contans trauma cohort, and may apply cleaning and aggragete propecess that specified to our task(post-truma sepsis).
